# WWDC15-Scholarship
The app I hacked together in a couple of days for the WWDC 2015 student scholarship. Code's really bad and hacky so it's no surprise that I didn't win a ticket as I had recently got into the world of iOS development.
I'd like to think I've gotten better at programming since then.
